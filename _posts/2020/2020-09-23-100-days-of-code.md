The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 23rd September 2020.

## Log

### R1D1

Reading "High Performance with Go". TL;DR
- Goroutine threads are different from OS threads.
- More light-weight and performant.
- Multiplex - Transmit several messages on the same channel
- Doubly linked list/Queues are part of the go library
- Anonymous functions in go

#### Anonymous functions in Go
```
func() {
    fmt.Println("Hello Go")
}()

var hello func() = func() { fmt.Println("Hello Go from an Anonymous Function Variable") }
hello()
```


### R1D2
