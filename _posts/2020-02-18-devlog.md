## postgres

Today is going to be all about postgres, I got the docker container pulled and working on that right now. But before that I need to brush up on my Database design skills which is completely different from coming up with complex SQL queries.

### TIL

I needed to access the DB file from the container, thought about adding a volume but there's an easier way of just copying files to and from the host/container.

The docker hub site has a bunch of other frequently used commands available. 

`docker cp foo.txt mycontainer:/foo.txt`

To login into the container:

`sudo docker exec -it my-mysql mysql -uroot -p`

### Wins of the day

* I have a docker container with a postgres DB and MySQL on it loaded for experiments.

### TODO

For embedded engineering I will have to brush on some networking concepts and hardware stuff which usually involves a lot of C and C++. I may not have to get into Django just right now. Database-wise PL/SQL is something I really want to study a lot more and Stored procedures.
