<p>Late blog post (already 2 weeks into the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen" target="_blank">program</a>) but better late than never.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2014/DecemberMarch#OpenStack" target="_blank">I got in :D&#160;! </a></p>
<p>Huge thanks to my mentor <a href="http://www.icchasethi.com" target="_blank">Iccha Sethi</a> and the rest of the OpenStack community for helping out with the bug fixes! I&#8217;ll be working on a <a href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/131610/" target="_blank">blueprint</a> (in review) to help users retrieve log files from a DB instance for the next <strike>3</strike> 2 months.</p>
<p>Before the start of the internship, the first task assigned to me by Iccha was to read up on the architecture of Trove. YouTube has a good number of helpful videos on it.</p></p>
<p>She gave a rundown on the code flow for the creation of a DB instance and gave some pointers on how to track the calls made on various modules using logs. I&#8217;ll do a blog post on that soon and another one on debuggers.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
