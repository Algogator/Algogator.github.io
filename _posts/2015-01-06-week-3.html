<p id="docs-internal-guid-dbcf54c1-bd0b-213c-9cc6-0e3ed44ff95c"><span>I’ve never written tests for any of my code.</span></p>
<p><span>Though I did write some for a class I had, a few semesters back with JUnit. But I wasn’t planning on becoming a tester so I didn’t see the point of digging deeper back then.</span></p>
<p><span>I spent the weekend reading up on nose, testr, pytests, mock etc. part of the blueprint requires me to write unit tests and integration tests; so now would be as good a time as any to really learn about it. I won’t try to squeeze in everything in this post, so maybe a series and I won’t be covering everything there is to testing, just the stuff I think is relevant to get things done. One huge benefit (from a non-tester’s POV) I see for writing tests for the code is that you can figure bits which could be made reusable. And reusable code = less typing for me.</span></p>
