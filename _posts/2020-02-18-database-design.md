## Overview
* Online transaction processing (**OLTP**) databases, in which users are concerned with creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, should be normalized. CRUD
* Online analytical processing (**OLAP**) databases which favor analysis and reporting works better with a degree of denormalization, we're worried about the speend of calculation/fetching data and the data doesn't really change that much. Also not a lot of inserts.
* **Composite key** is a primary key with two cols to identify a record uniquely.
* **Foreign key** it references the primary key in another table. They don't have to be unique and can be NULL too. Helps with referential integrity.
* **Transitive functional dependencies** changing a **non-key** column, might cause any of the other **non-key** columns to change
* **Cardinality** number of elements that interact between two tables.

## Normalisation

Without normalization all the data is in one table and kind of redundant.

#### 1NF

* Each table cell should contain a single value.
* Each record needs to be unique.

#### 2NF

* Be in 1NF
* Single col primary key (**no composite keys**). So partition table or introduce a new primary key.
* No partial dependencies.

#### 3NF (Standard)

* Be in 2NF
* **No transitive functional dependencies**. May need to partition and add foreign keys.
* At the very least should be in this form.

There's a BCNF (3.5) and then it goes up to 6NF but nobody really normalizes it beyond 3NF.

## Relationships

* 1-1
* 1-Many: Add primary key in the other tables making it a foreign key.
* Many-Many: In the scenario of students and classes. The way it is implemented is it involves breaking it into two 1-Many relationships.

### Many-Many

Create a new "entity" (table) to go in between the Many-Many. AKA associative entity.

## Best practices

* Stored procedures: Makes development more clean. Will write a completely new post for this.
