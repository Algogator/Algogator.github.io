<h2>Fix a "ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused" error in Ubuntu</h2>
<p>I was trying to install hadoop today and part of the setup was being able to ssh to localhost.</p>
<p>So I tried <strong>ssh localhost </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>ssh: connect to host localhost port 22: Connection refused</p></blockquote>
<p>So googled around a bit; ssh was up and running no problem there.</p>
<p>I tried re-installing it, still no luck.</p>
<p>Came across this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25699125" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/a/25699125 </a></p>
<p>Checked which port sshd was listening on <strong>sudo netstat -tulpen</strong></p>
<p>And what do you know, the port for sshd was not 22</p>
<p>I tried ssh to the said port:</p>
<p><strong>ssh localhost -p 12345</strong></p>
<p>and it worked!</p>
<p>Now I needed to change it:</p>
<p>Use your favorite editor to edit the <strong>sshd_config</strong> file</p>
<p><strong>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</strong></p>
<p>Look for something like</p>
<blockquote><p># What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for<br />
Port 12345</p></blockquote>
<p>And change that port from 12345 to 22</p>
<p>Restart and you’re good to go!</p>
<p><strong>sudo restart ssh</strong></p>
