<p>The newest addition to the CSMIT family is the Mozilla team - “MozMIT” a spinoff of the Firefox student ambassador program, was started the semester before. Its primary objective is to prep students so that they can actively contribute to the open source community(Mozilla in particular) as opposed to being mere users.</p>
<p>Mozilla has a number of projects under its umbrella so contributions do not necessarily have to take the form of code. A writer? There are a lot of new features that require documentation. If you are bilingual, consider translating articles, guides, tutorials etc.(L10N). If graphic design is your forte we have a place for you as well.</p>

<p>An “introductory” session was held last saturday at the computer centre in MIT mostly for the benefit of the new team members(so they know what they’re getting into). The speakers were Mozillians who actively contributed to various projects in Mozilla, technical and nontechnical - Shashank Gaikaiwari (Localization), Nikhil Patel and Achyuth KP(Appmaker, Thimble and Popcorn) and Vikneshwar (Coding). Plus the mozilla rep/evangelist Shreyas Narayanan Kutty.</p>

<p>The session got off to a good start after the ice breaker. And we managed to cover up everything in the agenda minus WoMoz, (support program for Women in Mozilla) ironically more girls had showed up that day. The Mozilla rep brought along his shiny new tab (Firefox OS) courtesy Mozilla (one of the few perks of being a mozillain) and we had a thorough demo on how to contribute to Mozillas codebase by Vikneshwar. The allotted 2 hours was a bit of a squeeze and before we knew it, it was time for lunch. We split up after the rep gave all the new members cute mozilla badges. So in short, it was a fun and productive session.</p>

<p>MozMIT is still recruiting. Drop by for one of our sessions to get initiated :)</p>
