So I have used Go before a couple of years ago to build micro-services, took a course and all of that. And recently I've had the opportunity to use it again to setup an api server on a small device. The other framework I say was Gobot which was specially made for IoT and more in my line. It's better to write it in Go than in C++ anyway. For this test I am using the Arduino Uno.


## Installing TinyGo on Ubuntu (https://tinygo.org/getting-started/linux/):

Install the dependencies:

`sudo apt-get install gcc-avr
sudo apt-get install avr-libc
sudo apt-get install avrdude`

`wget https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/releases/download/v0.12.0/tinygo_0.12.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i tinygo_0.12.0_amd64.deb
`
You need to add the path:

`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/tinygo/bin`

or have it permanently in your terminal by adding it to your .bashrc file

Test the installation:

`tinygo version`

Run the go code as:

`tinygo flash -target arduino blinkm.go`

## Installing gobot on Ubuntu (https://tinygo.org/getting-started/linux/):

You need to have Gort installed (https://gort.io/documentation/getting_started/downloads/):

`gort scan serial
`
This above command gives you the serial port address which is usually /dev/ttyACM0

`gort arduino install`

and don't forget to upload the firmata protocol

`gort arduino upload firmata /dev/ttyACM0`

else you will end up with errors like this:
