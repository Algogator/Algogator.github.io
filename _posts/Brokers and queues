"Celery is a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling."

"Redis is a message broker. This means it handles the queue of "messages" between Django and Celery."

You should note that persistence is not the main goal of this data store, so your queue could be erased in the event of a power failure or other crash. Keep this in mind and donâ€™t use the job queue to store application state.
Specifically, Redis is used to store messages produced by the application code describing the work to be done in the Celery task queue. Redis also serves as storage of results coming off the celery queues which are then retrieved by consumers of the queue.
