<h6>Registering for Classes</h6>
<p>Most likely you're not going to get the classes you want. Some of the more popular ones are going to have a wait list. The students who came in last semester are going to have the first pick; not much you can do about that.</p>
<p>To register for classes you first need to get rid of all your holds (you can see them on MyMav). So make sure you get here before orientation (at least a week before) and get all your medical paper work done. Pick the earliest international orientation date! and only then can you attend the department orientation and pick your classes.</p>
<h6>You're not going to get anywhere without a car</h6>
<p>Public transport in Arlington is limited. You have a train which will take you to Dallas or Fortworth but you're going to need a car to get to Centreport station. There is a rideshare appÂ <a href="http://bit.ly/2A1gRxc">Via</a> (use my code to get a free ride :D <strong>anna7j8j</strong> ) which has a $3 flat fare but the service area is pretty small.</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="https://lyft.com/ida/ANNA07190">Lyft</a>, which is cheaper than Uber.</p>
<h6>Don't buy stuff</h6>
<p>Besides your groceries. A lot of people graduate every semester and give away stuff for free! Vacuum cleaners, furniture, books etc. They're desperate to get rid of them so they can move out ASAP. Ask your seniors or keep checking the FB groups.</p>
<h6>Internships</h6>
<p>Companies start recruiting for summer interns the year before, so you need to start applying by August or September 2018 to get an internship in Summer 2019.</p>
